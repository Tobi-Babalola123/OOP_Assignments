# **Assignment Details**

## Description

This repository contains solutions for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignments:

### **Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class**

- Created a Python class named `Smartphone` to represent the concept of a smartphone.
- Demonstrated **inheritance** by creating a subclass `Smartwatch` with additional features.
- Implemented **encapsulation** using private attributes and getter/setter methods.
- Highlighted polymorphism by overriding methods in the subclass.

### **Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge**

- Designed a program that demonstrates **polymorphism** using animals and vehicles.
- Each class shares a common `move()` method but implements it differently for their specific behaviors.
